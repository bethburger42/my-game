	 			<h2>How To Play</h2>
				<p>
					In the game of WAR, there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. Cards rank from high to low: A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suits are ignored in this game. The object of the game is to win ALL the cards.
				</p>
				<p>
					DEAL: Click the "Deal" button, so that each player has 26 randomly dealt cards.  
				</p>
				<p>
					Players take turns clicking on the top card in their "Active Cards" stack. This turns the card face up and puts it on the table. Whoever turned the higher card has both cards added (face down) to their "Played Cards" stack. Then both players turn up their next card.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the turned up cards are equal there is a WAR. The tied cards stay on the table and both players play the next card of their pile. Whoever has the higher of the new face-up cards wins the WAR and all cards are added to their "Played Cards" stack. If the new face-up cards are equal as well, the WAR continues: each player plays the next card of t"Active Cards" stack. The war goes on like this as long as the cards continue to be equal. As soon as they are different the player of the higher card wins all the cards in the war.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you don't have enough cards to complete the war, you lose. If neither player has enough cards, the one who runs out first loses. If both run out simultaneously, it's a draw. Example: Players A and B both play sevens, so there is a war. Each player plays a card face down, but this is player B's last card. Player A wins, since player B does not have enough cards to fight the war.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins. This can take a long time...
